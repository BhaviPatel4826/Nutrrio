# Nutrrio
Ohlone Hack Project

Nutrrio hopes to solve nutrition problems. The three main parts of Nutrrio include basic information about essential nutrition, a veggie-growing guide, and connecting people to Nutritionists.
      Malnutrition is a global issue; the main problem is lack of education and information about staying healthy. We must build up our immunities to fight against our enemy, Covid-19. Nutrrio provides needed 
      nutrition to live a healthy life. Due to the growing pandemic, many people around the world are having trouble finding food either because of the lockdown or fear of getting Covid-19. 
      Nutrrio provides them with the process of growing their healthy food in their gardens or backyards. Nutrrio also provides the service of connecting people to nutritionists to help them stay fit.
